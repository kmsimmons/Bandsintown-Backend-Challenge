# Bandsintown-Backend-Challenge

I had a couple of different ideas here.

My first was to:
  Translate the data given to me into JSON,
  Create a table in DynamoDB,
  Put the .json files into an S3 bucket,
  Create a pipeline from the bucket to the table to transfer data.
 (Got stuck at the pipeline)
 
My second idea was to:
  Translate the data given to me into JSON,
  Create a table in DynamoDB,
  Create a Serverless REST API with Node.JS, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB & API Gateway.
  (Got stuck writing the logic to transfer the data into the DynamoDB table).
